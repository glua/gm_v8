A module for putting javascript in Gmod. Because it was totally necessary.

Currently relies on some windows headers. ~~Windows V8 headers and binaries are included.~~ Files too big, sorry.

Someone should tell me how to set this up with the build server.

I can't be bothered to document anything right now.
